# (My)? 

I sat down to write this and realised that:

1. `R` has a massive ecosystem

1. What matters to me is not necessarily going to matter to you

1. My background is different to yours

So instead of talking about 'essential' resources I am going to be talking about resources that have been important for my learning.

Hopefully I will cover some things that you find useful and if not hopefully I will point out some other ways of learning more that you can take.

Feel free to talk to me afterwards or contact me on Twitter (@seabbs) if you think I have missed anything out (I will have).

# The basics

---
class: inverse

# Rstudio<sup>1</sup> 

An IDE (integrated development environment) focussed on R.

## Pros

- Function autocomplete/suggest.

- Integrated help and plot viewing.

- Jupyter style interactive notebooks.

- Contains an integreted terminal, git client, database tab, data viewer etc.

- Great templates for presentations, packages, reports etc.

- Open source server version that works well in Docker (great for reproducible research/cloud compute).

# Rstudio<sup>1</sup> 

An IDE (integrated development environment) focussed on R.

## Cons

- Not an open source project. Run by a for profit company

Alternatives exist (i.e Juypter notebooks, Sublime + plug ins) but I would not recommend them to anyone and discourage anyone except from an advanced user from using them.

# R for Data Science<sup>2</sup>

 A fantastic book that aims to help you learn the most important tools in R  to allow you to do data science. Please read this book its free! 

## Comments



- Teaches a consistent framework (the `tidyverse`) for dealing with data. Other frameworks exist (i.e `datatable`) but I would personally recomend the `tidyverse`. 

- Learn to love the `dataframe`. All `tidyverse` tools are tuned with it in mind and sticking with it will massively improve your code. 

- `tidyverse` packages also have their own documentation<sup>3</sup>.

# Rstudio Cheat sheets<sup>4</sup> 

Cheat sheets for most of the major packages. Great to give you an overview of a package.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "45%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/syntax.png")
```

For those of you on Twitter you may like my random cheat sheet bot<sup>5</sup>.

# Getting Help


---
class: inverse

# Making a Reprex

The R community is very welcoming. If you can't find the answer you need feel free to ask. The first step is to create a reproducible example (reprex),

- Make sure your code is reproducible and contains everything you need to run it (i.e libraries).

- Make it minimal. Remove everything that isn't directly related to your problem.

The `reprex` package can help with this. See more here<sup>6</sup>. 80% of the time this will help you to fix your problem, for the other 20% try....

# StackOverflow<sup>7</sup> 

You've probably already used StackOverflow a lot already. It can be a great place to learn from previous questions, get help with unanswered questions, and learn from answering questions. Answers can be as simple as restarting R.<sup>8</sup>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/stack.png")
```

Make sure to use the R tag, as well as any others that are relevant. It can be worth checking out the similar questions section to see if any answers are lurking there as well.

# Rstudio community<sup>9</sup> 

If StackOverflow has a fault it can be that it is quite intimidating. The Rstudio community forum offers a nice change of pace with a much friendlier community. 

It's especially good for questions about the `tidyverse`, `shiny` and Rstudio more generally.

# Alternatives 

### Twitter

Can be a good place for question asking but most questions will be hard to fit into the maximum tweet length. Consider writing the reprex elsewhere and linking. More on Twitter in a few slides.

### Mailing lists

Many packages have their own mailing lists and this can be a good place to get help from specialists. 

###  GitHub Issues

Many packages are hosted on GitHub (or other version control sites). These sites allow users to open issues against packages. This can be a good option when you think you have found a bug.

# The community

---

class: inverse

# #rstats Twitter<sup>10</sup> 

A great place to get help, follow new developments, particpate in discussions and share work. Extremely friendly so feel free to just jump in!

Some suggested follows:

- **@dataandme:** For tutorials etc.

- **@cboettig:** Open science.

- **@noamross:** GAMs, GAMs, and GAMs (they are awesome check them out).

- **@topepos:** Tooling for machine learning. Try the book<sup>11</sup>.

- **@sellorm:** For a DevOps perspective on R.

- **@ShirinGlander:** Machine learning tutorials.

# Rweekly<sup>12</sup> 

Provides a weekly summary of R community content. Comparable, but better than, R bloggers as directly links to the source material and is more manageable (i.e weekly rather than daily).

Very welcoming so consider submitting any R work you are producing. Typically gives me 200-1000 additional blog views.

# ROpenSci<sup>13</sup> 

Aims to foster a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software.

Resources: 

- Infrastructure packages (i.e data APIs etc.)
- Forum
- Blog highlighting best practises, tools etc.

# The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)<sup>14</sup> 

JOSS is a developer friendly, open access journal for research software packages. If you need publications from your R work this is the perfect place. 

It can also be a great resource for finding new packages that meet certain standards (similar to ROpenSci but with a wider scope). 

Check out this paper (mine :)) for an example of the process<sup>15</sup>

# Packages

---

class: inverse

# The issue

R has a massive ecosystem. 

This can be both a blessing and a curse. 

If you find a package that solves an issue your having how do you know it is the best choice or if it is even working correctly? 

---

class: inverse

# What I look for

- Is it hosted on GitHub (or other version control)? If it only has a GitHub this means it is probably still under development so take care.

- Is it on CRAN?

- Does it have seperate documentation<sup>16</sup>?

- Does it have at least one vignette<sup>17</sup>?

- Is it being actively maintained?

If any of these are not true I would start thinking seriously about not using this package.


*Note: If it is an old, popular, package like `deSolve` then more latitude can be given.*

# Other standards

- Anything published by ROpenSci or JOSS will follow community best practises and likely be very safe to use.

- Packages published along side other journal articles are usually fairly complete. Note however that these packages sometimes get abondoned after publication.

---

class: inverse

# Build your own 

Consider building your own package early on in your R learning journey. This can simply contain some personal functions you use every day and doesn't need to go on CRAN. 

Learning to  make packages takes an afternoon and will teach you what makes a good package.

Resources: 

- R packages by Hadley Wickham<sup>18</sup>.

- `usethis` package<sup>19</sup>.
- Get inspiration from other packages. I use `dplyr` for this<sup20</sup>.

- Packages can be used to house analysis projects. See here<sup>21</sup>.

# Advanced

- **Advanced R:** A fantastic book by Hadley Wickham that explores the inner workings of R. A great resource for learning about S3 and S6 methods, Rccp etc.<sup>22</sup> 

- **Rmarkdown:** Produce reproducible documents using R. Great for literate coding. Takes a few hours to master<sup>23</sup>.

- **Blogdown:** Blog with R and Rmarkdown<sup>24</sup>

- **Bookdown:** Write books in R. Also great for publications, reports etc.<sup>25</sup>

- **Shiny:** Develop interactive interfaces with R. You can get your first app working in minute<sup>26</sup>. I recommend getting started with `flexdashboard`<sup>27</sup>.

# Tips

* Don't try and learn R in a vacuum. Pick a project and use that to develop your knowledge.

* Share your work as widely as you can. Preparing things for others to use can be a great learning process. 

* Don't worry about making things perfect. Develop, release, and repeat. 

* R is great as an interface. Interfacing with databases is a particular highlight<sup>28</sup>.

* Remember to use debug mode! Activated with `browser()`  in a function. Learning this has saved me hours when writing functions.

* Pick a few people to follow and review their work in detail. This can be a great way to learn. Feel free to stalk my GitHub<sup>29</sup :)
